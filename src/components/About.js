                    <p>I am Tabassum Islam. With a background in Computer Science and Engineering and having 6 months learning and practical expansive knowledge in MERN Stack developemnt, currently I am working with React JS in present. But from my undergraduate life I always had a passion and interest to work in web development. I have some project-based experiences with React js, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, Tailwind, Rest API, Node JS, Mongodb along with My-SQL and PHP. Recently I have completed four react based Projects. As I have always been passionate in web development, in my undergraduate life I did a project name ‘Researcher’s Collaboration’ which is also a full stack project using My-SQL and PHP.  I have also good programming skills in C, C++. I found myself as a quick learner if I want to learn anything with interest and dedication</p>
                    <br></br><p>Even I have also good team work experience, as I did some research works in teams and published two papers internationally with vital contribution and those projects are mainly based on  Machine Learning, Deep Learning and NLP. I always try to be up to date by learning and exploring new technologies. My future goal is to be a successfull MERN stack developer.</p>
